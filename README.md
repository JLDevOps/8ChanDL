  -w, --watch           Continually search for new images to download.
  -u UPDATE_INTERVAL, --update-interval UPDATE_INTERVAL
                        Interval in seconds after which to trigger a new poll

  -gh GEN_HASHLIST, --gen-hashlist GEN_HASHLIST
                        Generate hashlist from directory.
```

URL can be a 4chan or 8chan thread link such as:

http://boards.4chan.org/wsg/thread/738403/anime-thread-1730

or

http://8ch.net/wsg/res/45.html

##### Example: Download all .webm files of some thread

~/Pictures/Anime - is the folder where the files will be stored
>chandl.py -url http://boards.4chan.org/wsg/thread/738403/anime-thread-1730 -d ~/Pictures/Anime -ext webm

You can also download all extensions by leaving the -ext parameter out.

## Hash List
The program collects the MD5 hashes supplied by the API and uses them to skip files that already exist in the folder. It stores the hash list in a file it creates called .chandl/hashlist.

If your folder already contains images and you'd like to prevent unnecessary duplicates, you can generate a hash list from a local directory as well.

Example:
>chandl.py --gen-hashlist FOLDER
